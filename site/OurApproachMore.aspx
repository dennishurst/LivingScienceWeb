                        <h3>More about Our Approach</h3>

<p>Our approach is unique.  To create an environment that encourages students to move beyond academic excellence, we have consciously woven educational components into the Living Science approach that students do have access to in other programs.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>An integrated, holistic model</em></strong></p>

<p>When a child is accepted into Living Science, we pledge to build the foundation for growth socially, emotionally, mentally and spiritually.  We believe that education begins in the home and that you have built the foundation on which our team can add their specific talents and gifts.  We will prayerfully nurture the learning process, supporting young men and women through their critical developmental years.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>Teaching children, not a curriculum</em></strong></p>
<p>We will not sacrifice a student’s ability to learn about life through a subject merely for the sake of finishing a book or a curriculum.  Students are confronted with Biblical thinking as often as possible. They are challenged about their lives and relationships with others at Living Science and with parents and siblings at home. We create an environment that is safe for students to ask the tough questions and explore new ideas.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>Hands on learning</em></strong></p>
<p>We believe that students must be taught according to their learning style.  Hands-on activities within the classroom are designed to allow students to experience learning rather than passively observing a teacher lecturing. We employ block scheduling to allow students to dig deeper into the nuances of each subject, so that students can master concepts.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>Our Approach to Science</em></strong></p>
<p><em>“For this is the word of the Lord who made the heavens; he is God; the maker and designer of the earth; who made it not to be a waste, but as a living-place for man: I am the Lord, and there is no other.”  Isaiah 45:18</em></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>We believe that we must always be conscious of the true purpose of science.  The great difficulty with traditional scientific thought is that it regards the physical universe separate from our appreciation of it. At Living Science we see scientific knowledge through the eyes of love for God’s creation in its entirety.</p>
<p>The true purpose of science is to discover the laws which God placed in this world and to interpret them.  If we keep this perspective, then we will never come into conflict with the Bible.  We must go to the inspired Word of God for our point of departure. The Bible and the Bible alone is the primary source of our information; our teachings are integrated with Biblical text.  We teach to a literal interpretation of the beginnings of the earth or “new earth” as established in Genesis 1:1.  We also partner with AnswersinGenesis.org to support this endeavor.</p>
<p>But we also move beyond the theoretical to see God’s fingerprint in the world.  It’s a process that repeats daily.  We start with a devotion at the beginning of class and then the lesson builds on that message.  Children learn in a hands-on way and explore in a way that is age appropriate—little ones in the backyard and pavilion, later middle school to the shores of South Georgia and finally our older ones complete mission trips to destinations like Paraguay.</p>
<p>Our science curriculum is robust and inclusive, covering physical science, biology, anatomy, chemistry, physics, marine studies, oceanography and ecology.  Education is preparing to go from the known to unknown.  We teach our students to consider the tough questions and have an answer ready —for both the spiritual and academic challenges in life.</p>
<p>All of our science classes include strong laboratory and hands-on components.  Students access equipment and projects that are critical to their curriculum.  In fact, many of our alumni tell us that others want to be their lab partners in college because they are so well-versed in laboratory equipment and techniques. We teach in 2.5 hour blocks so that teachers lecture and then do activities.  We teach to all learning modalities in one class period so that all students master concepts.</p>
<p><br /></p>
       
<p><strong><em>Expeditions and Retreats</em></strong></p>                                             
<p>Excursions are an integral part of the Living Science curriculum.  While removing the walls of the indoor classroom, we show students the Creator’s work in its purest form.<br />
<ul>
<li>Spring Expeditions (Middle School):  We travel to Jekyll Island, Georgia as part of our science program.</li>
<li>Senior Retreat (High School):  This retreat is designed to expand students’ understand of the complexity of God’s creation.  The venue varies and is secret until the buses are loaded.</li>
<li>Servant Leader Training Retreat:  Also a secret destination, students here earn how to lead the Spring Expedition.</li>
</ul>
</p>                                                
<p><br /></p>

<p><strong><em>STEM</em></strong></p>
<p>The basis of Living Science is an appreciation and understanding of science and world in which we live.  This understanding then opens doors, creating a natural transition to its sister disciplines technology, engineering and math (STEM).   Science is the one subject that encompasses everything in life and helps students to be curious, ask questions, and make connections as to why the world exists as it does. It is the backdrop for understanding our world, and helps us to explain and appreciate it in new ways.</p>
