<p>Living Science is unique and well known for its “smorgasbord” approach to building a personal schedule for each individual student.  Science is mandatory at every grade level, but in addition to that, parents may choose to add any number of other listed classes to a student’s schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is therefore a financial benefit to bundling classes at Living Science.  This applies especially to STEM.  The table below and the explanations following make it clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>STEM Tuition Bundles</strong></p>  
  
<table border="1px">
<tr><td>Name</td><td>STEM Tuition</td><td>1st extra class</td><td>2nd extra class</td><td>3rd , 4th extra classes</td><td>Total</td></tr> 
<tr><td>4th & 5th  STEM</td><td>$1485</td><td>$440</td><td>n/a</td><td>n/a</td><td>$1925 for STEM and one other class</td></tr> 				
<tr><td>6th - 8th  STEM</td><td>$1995 (includes expedition fee)</td><td>$505</td><td>$420</td><td>$345</td><td>$3256 For 6 class bundle:
STEM & 3 other</td></tr>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example 1:  Intro Science ($1280) plus Spanish ($590) = $1870.  This is individual pricing.</p>
<p>Example 2:  8th grade STEM ($1995) plus Spanish ($505), and History ($420) = $2920. This is a STEM Bundle.  Because a student is enrolled in STEM, the bundle pricing takes effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lab fees and book fees are extra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Enrollment Fees: K-3rd = $50.00 // 4th – 5th = $125.00 // 6th – 12th = $225</p>
<p>Check the enrollment form for other second and third child discounts.</p>
