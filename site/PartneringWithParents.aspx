<i >&#8220;“Train a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.” Proverbs 22:6&#8221;</i><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>By amplifying parental efforts necessary to raise Godly and highly educated students, Living Science is a valuable partner to families who desire a Christian-based experience for their children.  The unique combination of a home-like classroom facility and dedicated teaching staff creates a comfortable atmosphere for the students while the rules provide a safe and structured educational environment, just like home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We work with parents, not for them.  We believe that parents should direct their child’s education and that they choose to send their students to Living Science because of its reputation to produce Godliness and a strong Biblical belief system in its students.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Together, we work with parents to uphold a set of values and expectations like:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Honor code: expecting students to do what is right because it honors God and their community.</li>
    <li>Atmosphere: creating and maintaining an atmosphere that is conducive to learning and growth for all.</li>
    <li>Conduct: being respectful and responsive at home and Living Science.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We try to develop a true partnership with parents.  Each student has the option of taking one or more courses in a variety of subjects, but they must take science.  Parents are welcome and encouraged to visit and listen in on lessons.  Even younger siblings are welcome on campus to do their own work as their older brothers and sisters take course work.  We have found that parents who involve themselves in the school reap the greatest rewards as a family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parents also play an integral part in our world experience outings—they are always welcome and find that they learn something new as well!  They are needed as drivers and chaperones.  This opens the door to a full-circle experience of learning and growing as a family unit.  Families also volunteer and help our staff with banquets, yard sales, and other scheduled activities.  We have a volunteer task force and each class has a coordinator for volunteer activities.</p>
