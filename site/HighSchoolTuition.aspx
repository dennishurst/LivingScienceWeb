<p><strong>Basic High School Tuition Bundle Pricing:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Living Science is unique and well known for its “smorgasbord” approach to building a personal curriculum for each individual student.  Science is mandatory at every grade level, but in addition to that, parents may choose to add any number of other listed classes to a student’s schedule.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is therefore a financial benefit to bundling classes at Living Science.  The table below and the examples following will help to clarify the options available.  </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
