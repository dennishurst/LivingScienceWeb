                                            <strong>Lance Davis, Headmaster/Administrator and Penney Davis, President/Teacher</strong>
                                            <p>Mr. and Mrs. D (as they are affectionately known) were born and raised in Africa.  Their heritage is unmistakably English, 
                                            their passion is for the Lord, and their love is for children of all ages.  They both graduated as teachers and began their careers 
                                            teaching in the African school system in Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.  Penney started teaching in a high school where most of her students 
                                            were close to being her peers.  However, she was unmistakably in control and taught her science students using hands-on techniques which 
                                            she had perfected while at college.</p>
                                            <p>Lance and Penney went to Bible College in Maryland, before they returned to Zimbabwe as missionaries.  After 4 years on the field, 
                                            they returned to the USA where Penney became involved in hands-on science teaching in the schools of the state of New York.  Lance 
                                            owned and operated a small business in upstate NY, before accepting a business challenge to move to Georgia in 1993.</p>
                                            <p>In 1996, while she was teaching at a local Christian high school, some mothers of homeschoolers approached Mrs. Davis and 
                                            asked her to teach science to their children. She considered their request carefully and prayerfully and, after confirmation from 
                                            the Lord, Mr. and Mrs. Davis started Living Science in the basement of the Davis home with a class of twenty students.</p>
                                            <h3>The couple have three passions:</h3>
                                            <ol>
                                                <li><em>They love God.</em> Through a God-centered, science-based, hands-on education, they help students reflect God’s truth and attract the next generation to Christ.</li>
                                                <li><em>They love children.</em>  They believe each child is rare and precious, created in God’s image and deserving of every opportunity to access truth, knowledge, and a rewarding educational experience.</li>
                                                <li><em>They love science</em>.  Science is the foundation for our program and the basis for our philosophy in showing the presence of God’s hand in every aspect of our world.</li>
                                            </ol>
                                            <p>They have a huge driving force to share with others who God is in their life.  This, coupled with a dedication to children, is
                                            the catalyst for a unique and enriching environment for all.</p>
