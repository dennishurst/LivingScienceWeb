<h3>Field Trips &#038; Expeditions</h3>

<i >&#8220;And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.&#8221; Romans 12:2 (NKJV)</i><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Middle School Students</strong> go on a <strong>Science Expedition</strong> to the Georgia coast each spring. The trip features the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong><em>Science</em></strong> – Hands-on experiments and activities are designed to show students God’s hand in all of creation. Learning takes place as students record information, analyze data, and present the results in the form of charts and graphs.</li>
    <li><strong><em>Mentoring</em></strong> – Students are led in small groups by Servant Leaders, high school juniors and seniors who are trained throughout their high school years to teach science, lead devotions, and care for the middle school students. Servant Leaders are supervised by school staff, who are available to assist when needed.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Biblical Teaching</strong></em> – In addition to the science activities and devotions throughout the day, students are entertained by an hour-long skit performed by Servant Leaders each evening that educates them about a Biblical view of science. The skit is followed by praise and worship music by Living Sound, our worship team, and a special Bible message.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Christian Community</strong></em> – Spending time focused on our Creator, steeped in prayer and worship and the beauty of God’s world, fosters Godly relationships that strengthen the Christian community at our school.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Family Involvement</strong></em> &#8212; Parent chaperones, along with Living Science staff, supervise all student activities on the trip. All parents who cannot, or choose not, to participate as chaperones are invited along with their younger children to go on the trip as “Hangers On” and become part of the Christian community on the trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>High School Students</strong> go on a <strong>Senior Retreat</strong> each fall to a location within a day’s drive of Living Science. The location varies from year to year, but has typically been to a coastal area.</p>
<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Science</strong></em> – Students conduct sophisticated science experiments and activities that prepare them for college science classes and labs, while being true to a Biblical view of science.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Mentoring</strong></em> – Students are led by Servant Leaders supervised by school staff.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Team Buildin</strong></em>g – Students participate in games, sports, skits, and other competitions designed to encourage healthy relationships in a fun and Godly environment. Activities are varied to give all students a chance to shine.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Biblical Teaching</strong></em> – Communal worship in the evening includes more fun and games, praise and worship music, and special talks applying a Biblical view to topics of interest to teenagers.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Parent Involvement</strong></em> – Parent chaperons assist the staff and students in daily activities.</li>
</ul>
