<h3>The Living Science Servant Leader Program Defined</h3>
<p>The Servant Leader program is one of the most distinctive aspects of the Living Science educational experience.  Both students and parents rave about the blessings and benefits it provides to students in their development as Christ-centered leaders in today’s increasingly secular world.<br />
A hallmark of Living Science, it is a privilege, not a right, to be on this team.  The concept of a leader team is biblical in basis and reflects the importance of servanthood.  The three levels of participation ensure that younger students are prepared to step into more responsible roles as the older students graduate.</p>

<ul>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> help in a science class, mentoring the younger students while increasing their own level of science knowledge.  Each Servant Leader is expected to assist with at least one science class, but many choose to help with more.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> lead the middle school Expedition.  They lead groups, teach about marine science, lead worship in the evenings, perform skits to enhance science topics, and are the main resource for all science activity to the middle school population.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> serve on the Senior Retreat for high schoolers, acting as teachers, leading groups, performing high level experiments, and raising the level of accountability by mentoring younger students.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> with gifts in the fine arts lead through worship teams.  Music and dance are important aspects of glorifying the Lord in formal worship services.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> have an opportunity to earn academic credit through their participation in science classes and trips.</li>
    <li><em><strong>Servant Leaders</strong></em> find that they grow closer to God, their peers and their families by serving others.</li>
</ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<h3>The program consists of three levels of participation:</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Trainee Servant Leader (TSL) </strong> High school students who have been with Living Science for at least one year and are qualified to graduate may be invited to apply to the TSL program.  The TSL training consists primarily of observing and following their Servant Leader’s example while learning how the team functions and studying leadership principles.</p>
<p><strong>Apprentice Servant Leader</strong>  These students receive detailed instruction from the leadership of Living Science team.  Their goal is to master the tasks and responsibilities assigned to them and demonstrate a teachable spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Servant Leader</strong>  The Servant Leaders commit to serve the Lord and the Living Science family unselfishly and wholeheartedly, while mentoring others.  They must exhibit Christ-like behavior to adults and their peers while upholding the principles of Living Science.</p>

<h3>Servant Leadership</h3>

<p>
<i >&#8220;“Be ye followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.” 1 Corinthians 11:1 (KJV)&#8221;</i><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Perhaps the strongest tenet of our philosophy is our commitment to consciously bringing faith into the daily action and lives of our students. Intentional discipleship means that we explore the meaning of discipleship and create an environment to help our students grow in Christ and live as disciples, loving God, their friends, and family members as themselves.  As disciples of Jesus, we are all on a continuing journey of being transformed by the Holy Spirit into Christ’s likeness, experiencing and expressing love for God and others.  We facilitate this through daily actions and programs such as:</p>
