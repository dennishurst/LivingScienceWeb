<h3>Why Living Science</h3>
            
<p>
<i >&#8220;But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.&#8221;</i><br />
<i >Matthew 6:33</i></p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>




<p><strong><em>Discipleship from the top down</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Our staff models the Christian life for all students through God-honoring speech and actions, class devotions, and prayer.</li>
<li>Our parents assist the staff in guiding students toward appropriate Christian behavior both at school and at home.</li>
<li>Our Servant Leader program seeks to mold high school students into strong Christian leaders who both mentor and serve our younger students on campus and on the middle school Expedition.  Younger students look up to the Servant Leaders and seek to emulate them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>School trips</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Middle School Students go on a Science Expedition to the Georgia coast each spring, and High School Students on a Senior Retreat each fall to a location within a day’s drive of Living Science. The trips features the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Science &#8212; Students get out of the classroom and into the outdoors, where they participate in hands-on experiments and activities designed to show God’s hand in all of creation. High school students conduct sophisticated experiments that prepare them for college science classes and labs.</li>
    <li>Biblical Teaching – Students share in daily devotions, participate in entertaining activities that make them laugh while teaching a Biblical view of science, and hear special messages about their faith.</li>
    <li>Christian Community – Students spend time together, fostering Godly relationships with other students, staff, and parents that strengthen the Christian community at our school.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong><em>“Safe” Environment</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Proverbs 22:15 tells us that “foolishness is bound in the heart of a child,” we expect our students to treat all others with Christian love and kindness, tolerant of any differences. Our staff, parents, and students do everything we can to ensure that all students on our campus, including those who may be especially vulnerable to teasing, feel accepted and surrounded by the love of God.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Defending the Faith</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>We teach Biblical views in all subjects at Living Science consistent with the views expressed in our Statement of Faith.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Unlike many other schools, we also introduce worldly views to our students, especially in high school classes. Students learn to spot the errors in non-Biblical arguments and to respond to them with Godly truth. In this way, students are prepared to strongly defend their faith and deal with the biases against Christians in college and beyond.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Individualized Curriculum and Instruction</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We know that all students have different needs and different learning styles. We help students by:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li> Offering a “smorgasbord” approach to our curriculum. Because our program is built on science, each student must be enrolled in a science class. Parents are free, however, to add any other classes appropriate for their students. We offer all of the required academic classes from fourth grade through high school, along with a number of electives.</li>
<li>Offering multi-sensory instruction. Some students are visual learners, some auditory, some kinesthetic; others have a combination of learning styles. We try to provide instruction using each of these learning styles so that all students can do their best. We also try to partner with parents to ensure that assignments are modified when necessary.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
