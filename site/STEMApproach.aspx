            Program for Fourth Grade through High School. Our innovative programs earned  Living Science a spot as one of three finalists in the 2013 Technology Association of Georgia STEM awards.</p>

            <p>Preparing students to face the challenges of the Information Age is an important responsibility faced by educators throughout the world. STEM Programs have been developed to address this need, and their popularity is growing. </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><strong>Here is what makes  the STEM Program at Living Science so special:</strong></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>God is first</strong> and foremost in everything we do. Students learn to see God’s hand in all of creation, and to appreciate His order in the universe. All subjects taught are in harmony with God’s Word in the Bible. Students will learn hard science that supports a Biblical view.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><strong>Our programs use a “hands on” approach.</strong> Students of all ages take trips in their science classes to remove the walls associated with the classroom and learn in a natural environment. Activities on these trips allow them to use all their senses to make lessons really come alive.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <strong>Our projects are used by scientists in real applications. </strong>Our students are well-behaved and well-disciplined team players. As a result, they have been able to participate in meaningful science projects. These include dune habitat studies in Cape Canaveral, Florida; rock fossil studies in Kentucky; and mangrove tree studies for the University of Florida.make the lessons really come alive. Classroom teaching is hands on as well: in various classes, students have designed and built Rube Goldberg devices, giant trebuchets, toothpick bridges, soddy houses, creature habitats, interactive games, and much more.</p>

            <strong>We accommodate many special needs and different learning styles.</strong> Living Science partners with parents to tailor learning to some of our students whose needs may be a little different from those of the typical student. Most classes are small, allowing extra attention to all students. All students also benefit from a multi-sensory approach in the classroom, which accommodates many different learning styles.</p>
