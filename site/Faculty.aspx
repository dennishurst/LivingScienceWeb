                                            When I was a child I found a particular verse in the Bible very funny. Psalm 34:8 tells us to &quot;Taste and 
                                            see that The Lord is good!&quot;  What?! How does one taste the Lord? As you know, young children have a 
                                            tendency to be very literal. I just couldn&#39;t imagine what the Lord would taste like, and why I would want 
                                            to taste him. </>
                                            <p>I love what Matthew Henry said in his commentary, &quot;Let God&#39;s goodness be rolled under the tongue as a sweet morsel.&quot;
                                            Science is one of the many morsels God has given to us in order that we might taste His goodness! It is my joy to lead your 
                                            child to &quot;taste and see that the Lord is good&quot; each week in our science class.  Along our journey together we will 
                                            make new discoveries by seeing, touching, feeling, hearing, smelling and yes, often by tasting! We will see the fingerprint 
                                            of our Creator, taste His goodness, and understand that it all points back to Him!

                                            <p>I was trained as a teacher in Africa.  The English system of education mandated that if I were handed a class to teach, as long as I could understand the content to be taught, I should be able to use good principles and practices in delivering an exciting, valuable and challenging lesson.  I love teaching to “kids”, young or old.  Watching the light go on as a math student says, “Oh, I get it!”, or seeing a real life-change in one of our Servant Leaders is still one of my favorite experiences.</p>

It is easy to leap out of bed every day and enter a science lab filled with eager faces belonging to kids and young adults who are ready to engage in learning for the purpose of one day impacting others in the same way.</p>

					    <strong>Beverly Dingley <br />
					    Spanish, Speech, and Drama</strong>
					        <p>Being on staff at Living Science allows me to pass on a love of learning and passion to my students. For me, it is easy to get 
                            passionate about Spanish since I have had the fun of visiting Spain, Peru, and Honduras. Being able to communicate while traveling 
                            is a huge motivator!  We have the added benefit of a large Hispanic community that gives plenty of opportunity to speak in Spanish 
                            right where we live. Students are given CDs with songs, dialogues, and readings so they hear the language apart from class.  It is 
                            wonderful when students tell me stories of how they have used the language!</p>
                            <p>In the realm of Speech and Drama, it is a great experience to take kids ages 12 – 17, many of whom have never met each other, and forge them into a team. Our class becomes a team that helps each person improve in their speaking and acting skills. Over the course of the year, even students that seemed practically mortified to speak aloud in a group become more confident. Day to day life provides constant reminders of the need for public speaking skills: church services, college recruitment events, and sports banquets, to name a few. I love seeing my students stand tall, make eye contact, and articulate their opinions with passion!</p>

                                            High School Technology</strong>
                                            <p>I have discovered a passion for teaching; especially teaching God&#39;s word and the application of technology.  I find that 
                                            theory without application is often boring and I seek to incorporate labs into my classes that provide practical application to 
                                            what we are learning.  God has led me to Living Science by way of the Marine Corps and a long career with Lockheed Martin.  
                                            I believe that my experiences as a Christian in these highly secular environments helped to prepare me for this incredible 
                                            opportunity to teach students in the uniquely edifying atmosphere that is Living Science.  I see STEM as providing a critical 
                                            underpinning for the understanding of the orderly nature of God&#39;s world.  I particularly enjoy the ability to work with 
                                            students as individuals rather than as products on an assembly line.</p>

                                            <p>My passion in teaching physics is to help the students understand some of the underlying structure God placed in our universe.  Our orderly God created an orderly universe for us to study, to learn more about ourselves and Him.  Teaching home school students is great because we set our own goals and schedules.  This year, in addition to our regular course work, we are building 8 foot tall trebuchets for our spring team project.  Not many regular schools (public or private) can offer this kind of opportunity.  I especially like teaching at Living Science; the focus is your relationship with God, whether you are student, teacher or parent.  We put much emphasis on the heart and attitude of the student; when the heart and attitude are right, right actions typically follow.</p>

                                            <p>Living science is the perfect fit for us as a homeschool family. My children love learning how God is a part of their everyday learning and academic studies. I am truly blessed to be a part of Living Science for the same reason my children love it. It is my pleasure to assist students in learning about God’s numerical creativity. My goal as a teacher has always been to take the fear out of failing math and bring in the wonder and excitement of critical thinking, logic, and numbers. The Bible reveals to us repeatedly, success can hold hands with failure. I encourage my students to not see failure or wrong answers as an end, but the door to learning.</p>

The environment here is contagious; the parents are involved and the students are engaged.  I have the freedom to use many techniques and be hands-on, involving the students in learning.  It’s so important to me that it is not just about learning Math or Science or English, but it is about the character and heart of the student.  Learning here is centered around the Creator and His Creation—the way it should be!</p>

I use the dissection of the cat in a lab setting every day to show how God&#8217;s Word is truth and He is the Creator.  My passion is to let each and every student see God&#8217;s marvelous hand at work and stand in awe of His works.</p>

                                            <p>As a first-year teacher at Living Science, I can honestly say that I never thought I would be a teacher, let alone a teacher for a non-traditional group of homeschoolers. In fact, I would always tell people that I didn’t want to be a teacher throughout my years in college. However, God had other plans! He enabled me to walk in the doors at Living Science exactly when the school needed a new English teacher and that was only the start of the journey! I teach High School English and Chemistry at Living Science and have been so incredibly blessed by this experience. Students at this school are respectful and caring, which makes the environment for teaching any subject optimal. I love getting to know these kids and not only sharing with them the knowledge of my subjects but also showing them the importance of wisdom that comes only from knowing the Lord. I also participate in several expeditions throughout the year where students are stretched academically and where God’s glory is shown firsthand in His creation.  Lives are always changed for the better on each of these trips as the presence of God fills every activity. I am truly blessed to be part of such a mission as this!</p>

                                            <p>God has given me the privilege of teaching elementary and middle school English at Living Science, and I praise Him for such a wonderful opportunity.  It is, and always has been, my heart’s desire to influence students to grow in their relationship with Him.  Believe it or not, it is possible to do it through grammar and writing.  My husband and I homeschooled our son through the twelfth grade, so I have a very special love for home school families.  God has used that experience along with my bachelor’s degree to give me a passion for teaching.   It is an amazing thing to be able to read, but how much more amazing is it to be able to understand the Word of God by understanding the grammar,  punctuation, and types of literature that give our language meaning.</p>

                                            Sincere worship is a priority at Living Science.  It is my goal to equip the singers and instrumentalists of &quot;Living Sound&quot; 
                                            to lead their fellow students to God’s throne using music. Our rehearsals focus on the essential elements of music as well 
                                            as the preciousness of being &quot;lead worshippers.&quot;</p>

                                            and a minor in music.  I have served various churches in differing music capacities over the past decades.  I currently attend First Baptist 
                                            Church Woodstock where my wife, Robin, and I are active choir members.  All three of our children attend Living Science.</p>

                                            <p>Being part of the Living Science family is so much more than top-notch academics.  Developing the students spiritually and giving them opportunities to excel is the priority.  Honors Algebra 1 gives the students a strong foundation for their high school and college experience.  I love guiding the students through the &quot;foreign language&quot; that is Algebra.  After graduating from Auburn University in 1995 with a B.S. In Secondary Education Mathematics, I taught public school in Alabama and Georgia.  I now enjoy homeschooling my own three children and the students I am blessed with at Living Science.
