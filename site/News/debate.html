<p>Is creation a viable model of origins in today’s modern, scientific era? Leading creation apologist and bestselling Christian author Ken Ham is joined at the Creation Museum by Emmy Award-winning science educator and CEO of the Planetary Society Bill Nye.</p>
                         
<p>Ham, a former science instructor who emigrated to the USA from Australia over 25 years ago, is joined by the popular children’s program personality Bill Nye “the Science Guy” for this first and only scheduled debate. Each man delivers what he believes is the best information currently available for his case. Each then has an opportunity for rebuttal and afterward answers questions submitted by the audience.</p>
                         
<p>The upcoming February 4 debate has already generated significant attention from national media, and tickets to attend live were completely sold out within two minutes of release.</p>
                         
<p>Don’t miss this “debate of the decade”! Watch at home, or organize to show the live stream to your small group, your youth group, or even your entire church. This event may be freely rebroadcast to groups so long as no admission or other fees are charged to any participants or attendees.</p>
                         
<p>The debate is to be held in the 900-seat Legacy Hall lecture arena at the <a href="//creationmuseum.org/">Creation Museum</a> (sponsored by <a href="//www.answersingenesis.org/">Answers in Genesis</a>).</p>
                        
<p>The live stream will be available to watch on this page, and it is being hosted by <a href="//plus.google.com/hangouts" target="_blank">Google+ Hangouts On Air</a> through YouTube. Furthermore, the live stream will be available for free on YouTube for a period of time after the debate. In support of our ongoing relationship with the deaf community the  debate, with nationally certified ASL interpreters, is available at <a href="//debateliveASL.org">debateliveASL.org</a>. The event is also recorded for DVD and digital download distribution to help offset significant costs in organizing and sponsoring the debate. Although the immediate release of the DVD  will be subtitled, it will not include the ASL interpreters, but we may add this at a later  date.  Sign up for the event on this page and we will update you by email  if this becomes available.</p>
